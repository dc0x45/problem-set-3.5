	    <p class="history">Brazilian Jiu Jitsu was popularized in early fighting organizations in America by the Gracies. In short, they came to the Americas and pust most other martial arts being used at that time to shame. A roll between a BJJ practitioner and an Aikido practitioner can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCNEhI7-yfA">here</a>. <br/> The Gracie challenge was first issued by Carlos Gracie in the 1920s to promote and develop the Gracie’s style of Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and as an attempt to show that it was superior to other styles of martial arts. The matches were advertised in local newspapers and typically featured a smaller Gracie versus a larger and/or more athletic looking opponent. Carlos, Hélio Gracie and their sons defeated martial artists of many different styles such as boxing, judo, karate, and wrestling, while experiencing few losses. </p>
