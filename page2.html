	    <td><h3>Gaurd</h3></td>
	    <td><p id="gaurdP">In the Guard, the practitioner is on his back controlling an opponent with his legs. The practitioner pushes and pulls with the legs or feet to upset the balance and limit the movements of his opponent. This position comes into play often when an opponent manages to place the practitioner upon his back and the practitioner seeks the best position possible to launch counter-attacks.</p></td>

    <tr>
	    <td><h3>The back mount</h3></td>
      <td>When using the back mount, often known in BJJ as the back grab or attacking the back, the practitioner attaches to the back of the opponent by wrapping his legs around and hooking the opponent's thighs with his heels</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	    <td><h3>Full Mount</h3></td>
      <td>In the mount position, the practitioner sits astride the opponent's chest, controlling the opponent with his bodyweight and hips. In the strongest form of this position, the practitioner works his knees into the opponent's armpits to reduce arm movements and ability to move or counter the submission attempts. Full Mount can be used to apply armlocks or chokes. </td>
