      <p>The belts in BJJ are as follows:<br/></p>
      <ol>
        <li>White</li>
	<li>Blue</li>
	<li>Purple</li>
	<li>Brown</li>
	<li>Black</li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li><p>The white belt is the first belt in BJJ. The rank is held by any person new to BJJ. A white belt's training should focus on escapes and defense as well as offensive tactics and positioning, as well as basic submissions.</p>
        </li>
	<li><p>The blue belt is the second belt in BJJ. At the blue belt rank, students gain more knowledge and go through many hours of mat time to learn how to use these moves. Blue belt is the rank where a student learns most techniques as well as what to consider when using them.</p>
        </li>
	<li><p>The purple belt is the third belt in BJJ. At purple belt, fewer new moves are learned, but the moves learned at the lower belts are improved upon and used more effectivly when rolling. Using BJJ techniques more effectivly can be understood in layers. A newer practitioner may posses knowledge of techniques, but what really seperates a more experienced practitioner is how many layers they can focus on at once. A newer person may be able to focus on two things such as force and angling. However, someone with a deeper understanding of the <b>same</b> techniques will be able to focus on balance, speed, force, angles, positioning, and more.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>The brown belt is the fourth belt in BJJ. At this rank, people tend to gain their own style of rolling. A brown belts game is also shifted primarily to attack due to having a very solid defence in place. They also have a good feel for the other fighter and are somewhat able to react more based on what tiny movements they do to set up their defence/offense</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>The black belt is the fifth and last "common" belt in BJJ. However, this does not mean that there is nothing left to learn or improve. The truth is quite the oposite, as it is here that you will begin to grow since the knowledge of techniques and how to apply them will allow you to focus on the nuances of what you are doing.</p>
