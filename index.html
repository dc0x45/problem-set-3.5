      <p>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, more commonly called BJJ was derrived from Judo and was popularized in the 90's by the Gracie family in 
      various MMA fights in the early UFC and other early fighting organizations. As you may have guessed the Gracies are from Brazil, and can
      trace their roots to a man names Mitsuyo Maeda, a very good fighter who earned a name for himself by competing in over 1000 fights with
      people of various backgrounds and not losing a single match. It was through these fights and experience in both Judo and Jiu Jitsu that 
      he was able to accomplish this. Eventually he retired and moved to a place in Brazil where he opened up a martial arts school which would
      go on to teach the Gracies. </p>
